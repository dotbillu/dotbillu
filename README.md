# Hey there

**I'm Abhay** — a full-stack developer trying to turn ideas into things that actually live on the web.

Currently, my go-to stack is `MERN` with `TypeScript` and `Next.js`.  
Been exploring `Rust` lately — trying to get closer to how things really work underneath.

## Currently I’m Learning

- Advanced backend & system design  
- Web3 and Solana  
- Low-level programming with Rust & C++  
- Scalability and clean architecture

not chasing perfection — just building, learning, and figuring things out one project at a time.
