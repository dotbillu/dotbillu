# Hey there

**I'm Abhay** — a full-stack developer who loves building things that actually make sense.

I usually work around the `MERN` stack, but I keep exploring stuff that goes beyond the usual web loop.

I’ve also dabbled in `Rust`, `Python`, and `Solidity`, and I’m currently digging deeper into:

- System Design
- Web3 and Solana
- AI & ML
- Distributed Systems

## Writing

If you're getting into full-stack or web3, check out my notes and projects — I try to document things that helped me learn faster.
